**Description:** This project demonstrates that I have a basic understanding of how to integrate a database within a Laravel application and can execute all CRUD interactions with the database.

**Details for teaching team:**  
My customized CSS is in the project folder: css/app.css; this validates via WC3 standards.  

Pages validate by WC3 standards. I tried to make the chore chart user friendly by including the following features:  
1. Error messages to direct users toward valid input and to advise whether user actions succeeded or failed.   
2. Functionality to edit, check status, tag and delete as well as create chores.  
3. Functionality to search by tag.

Features I would like to add:  
1. Ability to create/edit/delete tags.  
2. Ideally this site would have a parent as the user/administrator for a child's chart, with separate parent and child sign-in functionality. The parent would prepare the chart and confirm completion of chores, and a separate log-in would give children a view that includes chores and offers the ability to indicate completion of chores.     
3. Ability to track events to include columns for event date/time/place.  
4. Since the intended users of this application are children, would like to add much more color and interactivity, including more photos and graphics, the ability to choose from a reward chart based on completion of chores, maybe some zoo animal sound effects, etc.
